 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Things I enjoy in my day to day is spending time with family. Some of 
  my hobbies are atving, going on walks, and camping. My husband and I own a 
  doberman named Roxy and she is the sillist, sweetest girl who absulutely loves everyone. 
  I am currently in a position where i am one class away from graduating at St.Petersburg College
  on my AA degree major in Technology in the Web Development program with a GPA of 3.7. I always
  belive that hard work pays off, and always strive to learn more and look for better improvments
  in work and day to day life.
